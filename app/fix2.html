                <p className="activities-p">AMT maintains a competitive advantage over its competitors by leveraging its
                    network of local partners to ensure that we can offer our clients the best service in the market. We
                    strive to establish strong working relationships with our clients, following up and accompanying
                    them before, during and after their treatment process. This strategy would allow us to attract
                    client loyalty and improve our future engagements with potential clients through personal
                    recommendations.
                    In Kenya, AMT will establish and maintain reliable relationships with a wide network of medical
                    practitioners who are able to recommend our services to their patients. This would be a win-win
                    outcome for all parties involved: the patients access the much-needed support, the referring medical
                    practitioners are better assured that their patients would access quality medical care and return to
                    their care as quickly and effectively as possible.
