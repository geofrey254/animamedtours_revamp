                At Anima MedTours (AMT), we help patients experience top-quality
                healthcare in India. We support our patients in their journey to
                access medical treatment, procedures or routine medical
                check-ups in India. We advise our patients about the process,
                provide them with accurate treatment quotes from desired
                facilities, and ensure they have a seamless experience
                throughout the treatment and recovery process. After their
                treatment and return back home, we follow-up to ensure they
                continue their recovery process based on the treating doctorâ€™s
                prescription/recommendation.
